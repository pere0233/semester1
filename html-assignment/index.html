    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I’m Tasha Perera, but mostly people call me, Tash. I’m 18 years old and I love to design and learn new artefacts. Eventual career aim is to become a fully qualified and experienced Media designer, with the longer-term aspiration of qualifying as a Media Director.

    <p>
        I also play badminton and I love to sing. In my free time, I listen to classical music and I make a to-do list for the following day. I enjoy the nature and have 2 pet dogs who I spend most of my time with. I’m an outgoing person who socializes and make new connections with people.  I'm pursuing the <abbr title="Interactive Media Management">IMM</abbr> program at Algonquin College.
